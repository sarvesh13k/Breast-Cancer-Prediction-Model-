**Breast Cancer Prediction Model**

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on clinical features. The model is developed using a RandomForestClassifier and is deployed as a web service using Flask.

Introduction:
This project utilizes the breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to train a machine learning model that classifies breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The model is then exposed as a REST API using Flask, allowing users to obtain predictions by providing feature inputs.

Modules and Libraries:
Core Libraries
Python: The programming language used.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
shap: For model interpretability.
joblib: For model serialization.
Flask: For building the web API.

Model Training
The model training involves the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
Data Preprocessing: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the test data.
Model Saving: Save the trained model to a file using joblib.

Deployment:
The model is deployed using a Flask web service. The app provides an endpoint /predict where users can send a POST request with the required features to get a prediction.
